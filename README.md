# Web Scraping Project: Product Data Collector

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to scrape product data from e-commerce websites, specifically Amazon. The script extracts essential product information such as the product title and price, then saves this data to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**: The programming language used for scripting.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
- **Requests**: A simple and elegant HTTP library for Python, used to send HTTP requests to fetch web content.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python, used to create and manage the CSV file.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can set up the required libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas lxml

Hereâ€™s a well-structured `README.md` file for your web scraping project. This document will explain what the project does, how to use it, and any necessary details for understanding the code.

Once Python is installed, you can set up the required libraries by running the following command:

```bash

```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Open the script `web_scraper.py` and modify the `url` variable in the `main()` function to the desired product page you wish to scrape.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python web_scraper.py
   ```

4. The product title and price will be saved to a CSV file named `products.csv`. If the file already exists, the new data will be appended to the existing file.

## Code Explanation
The script consists of several key functions:

- **`fetch_product_data(url)`**: 
  - Takes a product URL as input.
  - Sends a GET request to the URL with headers to mimic a real browser.
  - Parses the HTML response to extract the product title and price.
  - Returns the title and price; if an error occurs, it returns `None`.

- **`save_to_csv(data, file_path='products.csv')`**: 
  - Takes the extracted product data and saves it to a CSV file.
  - If the file does not exist, it creates a new file; if it does exist, it appends the data.

- **`main()`**: 
  - Defines the entry point for the script.
  - Calls the `fetch_product_data` function to retrieve product details.
  - Prepares the data for saving and calls `save_to_csv`.

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling to manage potential issues such as network errors and changes in the website structure. If a request fails or if the product details cannot be extracted, appropriate messages are printed to inform the user.

## Future Improvements
- Extend the functionality to scrape multiple products by using a list of URLs.
- Add more product attributes, such as ratings, reviews, or images.
- Implement more advanced error handling and logging.
- Create a user interface for easier interaction.
